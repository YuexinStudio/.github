Yuexin Studio is an independent software and game development initiative focused on building tools that make storytelling more accessible, expressive, and modern.

### **Inkframe Engine (Active Development)**

Inkframe is our in-house visual novel engine, built from the ground up with clarity, flexibility, and strong visual identity in mind.
Our goal is to offer creators a polished, intuitive VN framework that combines:

* modern rendering
* clean UI systems
* responsive text and dialogue tools
* scripting power
* ease of use for both beginners and experienced developers

Inkframe is currently in active development and evolving with each update. Our priority is to deliver a stable, creator-friendly engine that elevates how visual novels are made today.

### **Our Focus**

Yuexin Studio exists to craft tools that help developers tell meaningful, atmospheric stories. We believe strong narrative design deserves equally strong technical support.

### **Current Status**

Inkframe is our primary project.
All development efforts, research, and updates are dedicated to refining the engine until it reaches full public readiness.
